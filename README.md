# VLSI-for-Mathematical-Function-Implementation
This project implements a hardware design using Verilog to calculate the mathematical function:
E = (A / 2^i) + (B × 2^j), F = E × C, where A, B, C, and E are 8-bit unsigned numbers, i and j are 3-bit unsigned numbers, and F is a 16-bit unsigned number. The design avoids direct usage of basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, /, shift/rotate) and instead implements them manually. A custom multiplier algorithm was employed for efficient computation. The project includes a modular Verilog implementation (mydesign.v), a comprehensive testbench (mydesign_tb.v), and waveform analysis for validation. Technologies used include Verilog, ModelSim/Xilinx Vivado, and FPGA deployment. Future improvements aim at optimizing speed, power efficiency, and scalability.
